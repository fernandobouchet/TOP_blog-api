# TOP_blog-api

This project was created with [Node JS](https://nodejs.org). Mongo DB is used as database. Multer is used to store and upload 'posts' images, jsonwebtoken and 
bcryptjs is used to handle passwords and login.


Project was created as part of one of the ['TOP'](https://www.theodinproject.com/) projects to learn NodeJS & Express, the goal was to create a blog, with a client view,
a separated CMS to create, edit, delete and update post, and a backend with an API rest.

Its a full-stack web app, a blog where you can read posts and write messages into them, this its the API source.
